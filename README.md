# Hi There, I'm Arjun Krishna

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an AI engineer specialising in **agentic & generative AI**, **MLOps**, **LLMOps**, **AIOps**, **deep learning**, and traditional machine learning. I enjoy building end‑to‑end AI solutions that combine classical models, modern LLMs, reinforcement learning and optimisation algorithms to solve real‑world problems.

## 🚀 Projects

Here are a few highlights from my repositories (check out the pinned ones!):

- **[enterprise_mlops_project](https://github.com/Arjunkrshna/enterprise_mlops_project)** – End‑to‑end MLOps pipeline demonstrating model training, experiment tracking with MLflow, containerisation & deployment, and CI/CD for enterprise telemetry data.
- **[AI_projects-1](https://github.com/Arjunkrshna/AI_projects-1)** – Advanced AI experiments featuring a GAN image generator, a reinforcement learning CartPole agent, and YOLO‑based object detection.
- **[AI_Project-Practice](https://github.com/Arjunkrshna/AI_Project-Practice)** – Comprehensive suite of agentic AI projects including research assistants, chat agents, real‑time analytics pipelines and retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) systems, along with deep learning examples (ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU).
- **[MLOps_project-1](https://github.com/Arjunkrshna/MLOps_project-1)** – Foundational MLOps project implementing best practices such as data version control, model registry, containerised inference and GitHub Actions CI/CD.
- **[RoadMap-to-Become-Data-scientist-and-AI-Engineer](https://github.com/Arjunkrshna/RoadMap-to-Become-Data-scientist-and-AI-Engineer)** – Curated roadmap and resources for aspiring data scientists and AI engineers.

## 🌱 Interests

I'm passionate about:
- Designing **agentic AI** systems that autonomously research, reason and execute tasks.
- Building scalable **MLOps pipelines** for reproducible model training and deployment.
- Exploring **LLMOps/AIOps** for large language model productionisation and system automation.
- Creating novel **deep learning** models for computer vision, NLP and time‑series analysis.
